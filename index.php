I'm a fullstack developer and a recent graduate of the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy, a competitive coding bootcamp where I became proficient in fullstack JavaScript. I also gained experience working on projects (both solo and in groups) and became very comfortable with working under tight deadlines.
				<br>
				<br>I would love to help you with your exciting and challenging endeavors - check out my resume and portfolio on the left, for more about my experiences!
				<br>
				<br>When I'm not coding or learning something new, I enjoy reading SFF novels and drinking lots of tea.
